# CS281_blogs

This is a repository for your lab blog post. Please write your blog post in markdown, in the post.md file. If you have a lot of images (you *should* have images), I suggest making an img folder to store them. Since this is a GitHub repo, for larger files, like videos, you should upload to cloud storage (Google Drive, YouTube, etc.) and link to them in your blog.

[Here is an example of a project blog post from Make Magazine](https://makezine.com/projects/perpetual-battery-free-weather-station/)

[Here is a cheatsheet for markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

Your post should appeal to a broad audience and be written in such a way that a hobbyist or layperson can reproduce the lab without any prior knowledge and understand what they should learn from it. You should motivate One way to think of this is writing for a student that has not yet taken this class.

Regardless of your chosen format, your blog post should motivate the lab activites, giving a high level overview of what is being done and what the reader should expect to accomplish and learn in completing the activity. It should provide enough details so that the reader can reproduce the lab, including any code and/or wiring details. You should describe how to test or demonstrate what is being built, and give example results from your own experiments. Finally, you should describe takeaways and their implications to help the reader process what you (and they) did and observed.

Take lots of photos and/or short videos as you are completing this lab, to help you to illustrate your blog
post.  Use what you learn over the course of completing the lab to structure and motivate your explanations. A subpar blog post will simply enumerate the steps that were taken. Instead, you should situate the procedures within a narrative of what the reader should take away from each constructing each circuit, Arduino program, etc. For example, “To understand
what a circuit is, let’s build a really simple one that lights up an LED. In this circuit, we have...”


The breakdown for your entire lab grade is as follows:
* 50 pts _Functionality_ (via sign-off from the professor or TA during the lab period). If there is a pre-lab, it will count as part of the functionality score. If you do not complete the lab during the lab period, you may receive up to half credit on missing points by demo'ing it during Professor Law's office hours before the blog post is due.
  
* 35 pts _Peer + Instructor Evaluation of Blog Post_ (this!)
If your evaluations are low-effort (e.g. no comments), you can lose 5 pts from this total.
If you do not submit your evaluations on time (there is a no-submission Canvas assignment to remind you), you will lose this entire 35 pts.
  
* 15 pts _Teammate Evaluation Score_
